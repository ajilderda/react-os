The component library with a native macOS & Windows look-and-feel.

## Project aim

- that adheres to the [Human Interface Guidelines for macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/) & the [Windows 11 design principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/signature-experiences/design-principles).
