# Desktop UI

The aim of this project is to become the de-facto standard component library for building beautiful, accessible and performant desktop UIâ€™s with web technologies (f.e. using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/)).

The planned features for this library are:

- a React component library built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
- a separate (framework-agnostic) CSS-library which adheres to the [Human Interface Guidelines for macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/) & the [Windows 11 design principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/signature-experiences/design-principles),
- starter templates for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) & [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) for jump-starting your desktop app.
